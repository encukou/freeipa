.SH "NAME"
ipa\-migrate \- Migrate an IPA server from one machine to another
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-migrate
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Use the \fIipa-migrate\fR command to migrate one
IPA server to an existing local IPA server installation.

Migrate IPA schema, configuration, and database to a local IPA server.  This
migration can be done online, where the tool will query the remote server. Or,
offline where LDIF files can be provided.  You can mix and match online and
offline. So for example you could migrate the schema and configuration online,
and then use an exported LDIF file for the database migration portion (this
might be more useful for very large databases as you don't need to worry about
network interruptions)

.SH POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fBprod\-mode\fR
In this mode everything will be migrated including the current user SIDs and
DNA ranges
.TP
\fBstage\-mode\fR
In this mode, SIDs & DNA ranges are not migrated, and DNA attributes are reset

.SH "COMMANDS"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Use verbose output while running the migration tool.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-hostname=HOSTNAME\fR
The host name of the remote IPA server that is being migrated from.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-bind\-dn=BIND_DN\fR
The Bind DN (Distinguished Name) or an LDAP entry to bind to the remote IPA server with.
Typically this is "cn=directory manager", but it could be any entry that has
access to read the userPassword attribute.  If ommitted the default is "cn=directory manager"
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-bind\-pw=PASSWORD\fR
The password for the Bind DN that is authenticating against the remote IPA server.  If
a password is not provided then the tool with prompt for the password if needed.
.TP
\fB\-Just\fR, \fB\-\-bind\-pw\-file=FILE_PATH\fR
Path to a file containing the password for the Bind DN.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR, \fB\-\-cacertfile=FILE_PATH\fR
Path to a file containing a CA Certificate that the remote server trusts
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\-file=FILE_PATH\fR
Path to a file containing the migration log.  By default the tool will use \fI/var/log/ipa-migrate.log\fR
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-dryrun\fR
Go through the migration process but do not write and data to the new IPA server.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-dryrun\-record=FILE_PATH\fR
Go through the migration process but do not write any data to the new IPA server. However, write the
migration operations to an LDIF file which can be applied later or reused for multiple migrations.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reset\-range\fR
Reset the ID range for migrated users/groups. In "stage-mode" this is done automatically
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Ignore any errors and continue to proceed with migration effort.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Only log errors during the migration process.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-migrate\-dns\fR
Migrate thr DNS records
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-schema\fR
Do not migrate the database schema
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-config\fR
Do not migrate the database configuration (dse.ldif/cn=config)
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-schema\-overwrite\fR
Overwrite existing schema definitions.  By default duplicate schema is skipped.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-subtree=DN\fR
Specifies a custom database subtree that should be included in the migration.
This is only needed if non-default subtrees/branches were added to the database
outside of IPA.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-db\-ldif=FILE_PATH\fR
LDIF file containing the entire backend. If omitted the tool will query the remote IPA server.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-schema\-ldif=FILE_PATH\fR
LDIF file containing the schema. If omitted the tool will query the remote IPA server.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-config\-ldif=FILE_PATH\fR
LDIF file containing the entire "cn=config" DIT. If omitted the tool will query the remote IPA server.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-prompt\fR
Do not prompt for confirmation before starting migration.  Use at your own risk!

.SH "POST MIGRATION"
\- The server is left in migration-mode so that the migrated users can more
easily reset their passwords either by authenticating via SSSD or using the
web-based password migration page. This authentication will generate new
Kerberos keys. After passwords are reset the server should be taken out of
migration mode.

\- All hosts are preserved, but they will need to be re-enrolled using
ipa-client-install (e.g. ipa-client-install --uninstall && ipa-client-install).

\- All certificates should be re-issued against the new CA.

\- Any manually created keytabs will need to be re-created using
\fIipa-getkeytab\fR

\- Vaults are not migrated and will have to be re-created.

\- Sub CA's are not migrated and will have to be re-created.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
0 If the command was successful

1 If an error occurred

2 If the local host or remote host is not an IPA server, the IPA server
  installation is faulty, or the realm can not be determined
